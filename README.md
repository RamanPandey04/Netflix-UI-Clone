# Netflix-Clone-Using-HTML-CSS
This project is a Netflix sign-in page clone built with only HTML and CSS. It replicates the original design, including the logo, form fields for email and styled buttons. The focus is on achieving a pixel-perfect, responsive layout with clean, organized code, without using JavaScript or frameworks.
